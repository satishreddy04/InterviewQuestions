1) The main difference between Angular and React is 
   a) Framework vs Library - React is javascript library and updates virtual dom,uni directional data flow          
                              Angular is Javascript framework which updates Real DOM, bi directional data flow
   b) angular uses typescript, React uses JSX
   c) Angular is easy to setup but takes time to deliver projects since it involved lot of suntax for simple things
      React takes longer for setup but build apps relativerly quickly 
   d)   Perfomrance - React performace is great because of virtual dom 
        Angular performance is worse becase of complex and synmic web apps. The main reason because of bidirectional data binding 
        eachbinding -> watcher -> tracj chnages -> each loop continues -> untill watches and associate values are checked

1) What is Angular Framework?
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that makes it easy to build applications with in web/mobile/desktop. 
The major features of this framework such as declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and
many more other features are used to ease the development.

2) Difference between Angular JS vs Angualr 
Angular is a completely revived component-based framework in which an application is a tree of individual components.

AngularJS	Angular
It is based on MVC architecture-This is based on Service/Controller
This uses use JavaScript to build the application-	Introduced the typescript to write the application
Based on controllers concept-This is a component based UI approach
Not a mobile friendly framework-Developed considering mobile platform
Difficulty in SEO friendly application development

3) what are main blocks or key components of Angular
 components - basic building of application to control html views 
 modules - its kind of a building block which cpntaines components, directive, services etc
           where each is divided intlo logical pieves and each piece of code is called modu
 Templates - represnets view of angular application 
 services - ceate a component which can share accorss th eentire applicaiton 
 MetaData - can be add more data to angular class
 
4) What are directivnes 
   Directives are nothing but it adds a behaviour to an exisiting DOM or exisiting compo
   we can defined directive @directive 
   import {directive} from '@angular core'
   
5) What are components 
  components are basic builfing blocls of an angular app 
  import {component} from '@angular/core'
  @component({
  selector:'my-app',
  template:`<div></div>`
  })
  
only one component can be present per DOm element and @view or template URL is mandiatory 

6) What are templates 
A template is a HTML view where you can display data by binding controls to properties of an Angular component. You can store your component's template in one of two places. You can define it inline using the template property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the @Component decorator's templateUrl property.
   
7) What is a module 
 modules are small chunk divided into seperate modules to maintian the seprarte functinlaity 
 of application 
 import {Ngmodule} from '@angular/core'
 import {BrowserModiule} from 'angualr/platofprm-browser'
 import {Appcomponent} from './app.componet';
 @Ngmodule({
 imports:[Browser module]- to add dependent modules. browserModule is required by web based angular applciation
 declarations:[Appcomponent]- defined components in the respective module
 bootstarp:'[Appcomponet] - for bootstraping the application
 providers:[] - used for set of injectabel objects 
 })
   
8) LifeCycles 
  ngOnchhange - dataa bound porerty changes 
  ngoninit - at the time of initilization 
  ngDoCheck - detection and to cact changes 
  ngAfterContentInitit - 
  ngAfterContentChecked
  ngAfterViewInit
  ngAfterViewChecked
  ngOnDestriy
  
9) What is data binding 
Data binding is amin concemtpt it allows the communicatoin between component and DOm
1. Componet to DOM -> through interopolatino - {{user.name}}
                      through propertyBinding - <input [value]='user.email'>
 2. From Dom to component -> like events binfind 
                            <button (click)='logout()' />
 3. two way data binding - [(ngModule)]

10) What is Meta data 
it is used to decorate the class so that it configure the expected behaviour of the class


11) Anfular CLI - command line to build angular apps modules node style 

12) Difference between constructor and ngOnInit
   cpnstructor -> initilization purpose -> called firs time before ngOnInit()
   ngOninit-> specific to Angular purpose -> callef after constructor
   
13) Service is used as a common functinlaity needs to porivde for various modules 
   import {Injectable} from '@angular/core'
   import {Http} form 'anfular/http'
   @inhectables

14) What is dependency Inhection - 
  DI is an application pattern in which class asks for dependencies from external source rather than 
  craeting them itseld.
  
15) What is async pipoe 
    it subscribe to an observable or promise and returns the latest value it has emmited

16) pupose of ngFOr -> display each item in list

17) what are observables 
   Observables are declartive which provide support for passing messages between publisher and sunscriber
   used mainly for event handling, asynchronois programming and hanlding mulltiple values 
   unitll consumer subscribe it the event will not be executed 
   
 18) What are the various kinds of directives?
There are mainly three kinds of directives,
Components — These are directives with a template.
Structural directives — These directives change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
Attribute directives — These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

19) What is the purpose of base href tag?
The routing application should add element to the index.html as the first child in the tag in order to indicate how to compose navigation URLs. If app folder is the application root then you can set the href value as below

<base href="/">
